# Handwritten Digit Recognition 

This repository contains a Python-based project for recognizing handwritten digits using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to draw or upload digits for prediction.



## Features
• Interactive GUI for digit input.

• Neural network model for digit recognition.

• Pre-trained weights for quick predictions.

• Modular design for easy customization and scalability.


## Files Overview

 - GUI.py: Implements the graphical interface for user interaction.

 - Model.py: Contains the neural network architecture.

 - Prediction.py: Loads trained weights and makes predictions.

 - RandInitialise.py: Initializes weights for the neural network.

 - Theta1.txt & Theta2.txt: Store the pre-trained weights.

 - main.py: Entry point for running the application.

 - mnist-original.mat/: Includes the MNIST dataset for training and testing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SankethSingh/Handwritten-digit-recognition.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
Run the application:
